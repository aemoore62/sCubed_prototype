    <b>Attention!</b> You should not add terms to drop-down lists by clicking the pencil (Edit button) that Google
    displays in the drop-down lists. Drop-down lists should only be updated by entering information into the
    sheets and then selecting <i>Refresh data validation</i> from the sCubed menu.
    <br>
    <br>
  Below is a list of the columns with drop-down lists that sCubed does not intend for you to edit, meaning these lists cannot be updated with the item
    <i>Refresh data validation</i>. These lists
    include keywords that support the functionality of sCubed.
